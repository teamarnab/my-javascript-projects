# Simple Web Projects

## Description
This repository contains a collection of simple web projects built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. These projects demonstrate the use of front-end and back-end technologies to create interactive web applications. The goal is to practice full-stack development by integrating front-end design with server-side functionality.

## Features
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic structure and styling for web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the projects.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Back-end server setup and routing.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: Template engine used for rendering dynamic content.
